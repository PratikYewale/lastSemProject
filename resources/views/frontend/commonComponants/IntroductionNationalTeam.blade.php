                                <p>The National team comprises individuals selected through a meticulous process based on their outstanding performances in national-level competitions.</p>
                                <p class="collapse" id="collapse4">Selection to the National Team is a testament to the athletes' dedication, skill, and commitment to their craft. The selection criteria are transparent and merit-based, relying on the SSI points system for competitions organized under the aegis of the SSI (Ski and Snowboard India). Additionally, consideration is given to the top-ranked FIS athlete in each event under consideration for inclusion in the team.</p>
                                <p class="collapse" id="collapse4">It is essential to note that while SSI permits individual athletes to participate in international events on an individual basis, subject to SSI approval, the composition of the National Team is exclusively determined by a predefined list updated periodically by SSI.</p>
                                <p class="collapse" id="collapse4">The National Team encompasses a range of disciplines, including Alpine Skiing (Slalom and Giant Slalom), Cross-Country Skiing (Sprint and Distance), and Snowboarding. Each athlete selected for the team embodies the highest standards of sportsmanship, athleticism, and dedication to their respective sport.</p>
                                <p class="collapse" id="collapse4">As members of the National Team, athletes serve as ambassadors for their country, showcasing the talent and potential of Indian winter sports on both national and international stages. Together, we strive for excellence, pushing the boundaries of achievement and inspiring future generations of athletes to reach for the stars.</p>
                                <p class="collapse" id="collapse4">The SSI reserves the right to nominate one wildcard entry for each gender and terminate membership of the National team at its sole discretion. </p>
