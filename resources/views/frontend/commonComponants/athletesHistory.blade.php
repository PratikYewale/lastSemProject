                                 first Indian to compete at the Winter Olympics. Born in Lithuania to Polish parents, he
                                 had more exposure to winter sports than the average Indian at the time. Although he
                                 couldn’t complete his race in 1964, he returned in 1968 to participate in three events:
                                 men’s downhill, slalom, and giant slalom.
